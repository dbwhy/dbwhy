Hey there!

I'm relatively new to this software stuff but am thoroughly enjoying myself so far!
While I had a couple programming classes en route to a bachelors degree, the majority of my learning in this realm has been self-taught!

My [software] interests include the AI/Machine Learning/NN field as well as anything that may tie back to music, nutrition, or furthering the fight for equality. I've designed some analog audio effects but eventually, I plan on creating my own digital audio effects (both physical & plugin variations) as well!

I'm certified as a TensorFlow developer by TensorFlow and DeepLearning.AI!

Short term [software] goals of mine include: becoming more comfortable with C++ and beginning my journey into the signal processing world.
