Hey there!

I'm David.

A largely self-taught programmer with a BSEE background, TensorFlow Developer certification (by Google's TensorFlow & DeepLearning.AI), and am currently working as a Hardware Engineer in Seattle, WA.

My [software] interests include embedded design, AI/ML, or anything that may tie back to music, the environment, or furthering the fight for equality.

Short term [software] goals of mine include: becoming more proficient with C++

Call your mom!
